Algorithms for Automated Path Planning for Washing in Biochips
==============================================================

Residues left inside a Digital Microfluidic Biochip during its operation may affect the further operation leading to unexpected behavior. Modelling the Biochip structure into an undirected graph, algorithms can be designed for automated washing of the residues by efficient routing of a droplet inside the chip. These algorithms are also applicable in several other real world problems like New York Street Sweeping, Snow Clearing, Minimum Postmen Cover and Software Testing etc.

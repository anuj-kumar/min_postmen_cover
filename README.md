min_postmen_cover
=================

My Final Year Academic Project.

Problem:
To cover all the edges of a given graph using minimum number of paths keeping the total path weight within a given constraint Q.

The problem can be modelled into several real world problems, the best one I'll say is the Garbage Collector Van Routing, in which Garbage Vans have to be guided to cover all the roads of a city, and collect the garbage, without exceeding the Capacity Q of the van.
